A Generalized Biologically Plausible Action Selection System for
Cognitive Architectures
======================================================================

This study extends the results of Stocco et al (2018).

The Original Study
------------------
In the original study, Stocco outlined a method to capture the biology
of the basal ganglia within a production-system based
architecture. In essence, the main idea was that:

 (1) One of the main features of BG anatomy is the presence of two
 pathways, the direct and the indirect pathway, that respond in
 opposite ways to the releas of dopamine.

 (2) This distinction is important for humans, as it explains effects
 of disease (PD), medication (L-Dopa), as well as individual
 differences related to striatal Dopamine genetics (D1/D2).

 (3). This difference is not captured in current production
 systems. In essence, current production systems capture only the
 "direct" pathways, forgetting the indirect one.

 (4) To obviate this problem, Stocco (2018) added a second series of
 productions, which capture the indirect pathway by picking the
 *opposite* alternative in a decision choice---that is, a production
 rule that recognizes option 'A' will select any other option but
 'A'. In other words, such 'anti-productions' would veto 'A', or any
 other options they are specialized for. Each option 'A', thus, has a
 corresponding 'Pick A' and a 'Do not pick A' production competing
 with each other. 

This system was capable of reproducing the results of a number of
landmark studies (Frank et al., 2004; 2007). However, it has
suffered from the following limitations:

 (1) The biological plausibility was broken because a reward signal
 would in fact reinforce an 'anti-action' produced by the indirect
 pathway. This is in contrast to the biology of the system, where
 active neurons in the indirect pathway (striatopallidal neurons) are
 consistently *inhibited* by dopamine.

 (2) As explained in the Discussion section of the original paper,
 this general production/anti-production scheme has limited
 generalizability. For example, it is not clear what an
 'anti-production' in the case of a three-alternative choice. When
 asked to choosen between 'A' and 'B', a production that vetoes 'A'
 obviously chooses 'B'. But what should the same production do when
 choosing between 'A', 'B', and 'C'? Several schemes can be
 envisioned; the production could remove 'A' from the pool and reduce
 the choice set to 'B' and 'C' only; or it could pick randomly between
 'B' and 'C'. These solutions are equally plausible but, and this is
 the point, there is no obvious way to pick between them.

 (3) Because the operations performed by anti-productions are
 depending on the amount of options available, there is not an obvious
 'syntactic' way to generate anti-productions given the normal
 productions. This is a grave limitation in making the system
 architectural.

 (4) In parallel systems that can fire multiple productions at the
 same time (EPIC), productions and anti-productions cannot be
 implemented---at least, not in a straightforward way.

The Solution
------------
The solution proposed here is not to modify the productions, but to
modify the credit assignment algorithm. After a reward signal R_t has
been generated,  the algorithm would assign credit to all the
productions that have fired according to some temporal assignment
rule. However, within all actions a_1, a_2 ... a_N in a conflict set,
the rewards will be assigned according to the following rule:

        |- U^i_{t-1} + \alpha * (d_1 * R_t - U^i_{t-1})    if i == j
U^i_t = +
        |_ U^i_{t-1} + \alpha * (d_2 * -R_t - U^i_{t-1})   if i != j

Assuming that j is the index of the action that was selected.

This scheme is equivalent to the previously proposed 'Double Q
learning' if one assumes that that d_1 = d_2.

This system has none of the limitations of the previous algorithm. It
remains to be seen whether this system can, in fact, perform as well
as the previous algorithm, or even surpass it.
