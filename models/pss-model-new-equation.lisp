;;; AN ACT-R MODEL OF THE PROBABILISTIC STIMULUS SELECTION (PSS) TASK
;;; BASED ON COMPETITIVE BASAL GANGLIA DYNAMICS. 
;;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; This is a biologically-plausible, competitive implementatin of
;;; of the PSS task in ACT-R. Different than the canonical model,
;;; it requires two setb of productions ("Pick A, B, ... F" and "Don't
;;; Pick A, B,... F"), whose utilities are updated and controlled
;;; by different equations and parameters (see pss-device.lisp).
